**Note: It is crucial to acknowledge that while my GitHub projects demonstrate my ability to complete individual tasks, they may not accurately reflect my current skills and abilities. Developing an exceptional project independently, with a focus on clean code practices, requires significant time and effort. Collaborating with a team on larger projects is known to facilitate progress and the implementation of clean code practices, which I am eager to experience and contribute to.**
